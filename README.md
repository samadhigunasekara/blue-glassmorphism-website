# Blue Glassmorphism Website

This is a simple web project that demonstrates the glassmorphism effect using HTML and CSS. Glassmorphism is a modern UI design trend that creates a frosted glass-like appearance for elements on a web page. The project consists of a single HTML file and a CSS file that style the page.

The project was inspired by this [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/p1GmFCGuVjw?list=PLcWEHSpTzhuAWQTzfZ_uvvfG4xZAvW6FA) by [Codehal](https://www.youtube.com/@codehal). Required credits go to the original author for providing the guidance.

## How to modify the project

If you want to modify the project, you can edit the HTML and CSS files according to your preferences. Here are some suggestions on what you can change:

- The background image of the page. You can use any image URL or local file path in the `background-image` property of the `body` selector in the CSS file.
- The color scheme of the page. You can change the values of the CSS variables `--primary-color` and `--secondary-color` in the `:root` selector in the CSS file. These variables control the color of the text, buttons, and borders on the page.
- The content of the page. You can change the text and images inside the `container` div in the HTML file. You can also add more elements or remove some elements as you wish.
